# Integration status

Status date: **2026-09-07**

Pinned official upstream: `a04446e57ec1fbc252a871afcec7752fb2807b14`

This dashboard summarizes the live integrated tree. Detailed evidence remains
in each corpus dossier and in the machine-readable registry.

**R47, the combined Illusie source and EGA I §6.6.5 are public** at
`5817f4c1af8724b147401c785f57ca315b52e31c` (anonymous main-ref verification).
The combined build receipts record two matching sets of 35 PDFs, comprising
3,363 pages and 36,679,971 bytes. Visual evidence is bounded to the scopes
actually recorded in those receipts; these totals do not claim all-page
visual certification of the entire corpus.

This tree also contains the validated EGA I §6.6.6–§6.6.8 comparison at
`53e97d65a7efb5e4f79df83cea987ae2ea08a171`: permanence of locally finite-type
morphisms, locally Noetherian fibre products, and geometric-point arguments.
It changes no root TeX or PDF input. The separate
[integration validation](validation/ega-i-6.6.6-6.6.8-integration-validation-2026-09-07.json)
records the passing 16-test semantic suite and full repository check.
The checkpoint is public at `27947f240bbe0fed5cf7e91239a1ebe238a85bb2`;
[anonymous readback](validation/ega-i-6.6.6-6.6.8-public-readback-2026-09-07.json)
matched all 15 changed files (1,888,511 bytes). The later test-fixture repair
passed [exact-head CI](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/actions/runs/34154661350)
at `bc2db1e2b9829bff6c1d98091f40bbc6a312e9b0`, preserving the historical
receipts and their source hashes.

The preceding comparison covers **EGA I §7.1.1–§7.1.3: rational maps and rational
functions**. Existing Stacks results supply the definitions, restriction,
graph/section correspondence and ring operations. A direct check of the
original printed page confirms a proof overstatement about agreement on an
entire overlap; the comparison supplies the correct dense-witness argument.
The [integration checks](validation/ega-i-7.1.1-7.1.3-integration-validation-2026-09-07.json)
pass, including complete raw-source boundary replay. No duplicate root
theorem is added. That checkpoint is publicly byte-verified at
`056fd2bb05c6a5f82dcad9f193ad63d35790b56b` with
[exact-head CI PASS](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/actions/runs/34157334212).

The new **EGA I §7.1.4–§7.1.9.1 comparison** explains generic morphism germs,
finite-component products of rational-function rings, the Noetherian
Artinian conclusion, and localization away from minimal primes. The
[dossier](ega/i719.md) supplies independent derivations and the hypothesis
counterexamples. All statements and separately owned proof passages are bound
to exact French and English source slices. Existing Stacks covers this
mathematics, so no duplicate root theorem or new PDF build is introduced.
The next source unit is **§7.1.10**; EGA remains incomplete.
The [public readback](validation/ega-i-7.1.4-7.1.9.1-public-readback-2026-09-07.json)
verifies every changed file at `e9a6a302f753d7a0564c1ca0cf323ffb9f07fb77`;
its [exact-head CI passed](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/actions/runs/34161450235).

The [development program](ROADMAP.md) records the wider EGA, Tôhoku, Verdier,
DAG, prismatic, modular-theory and reader work. Inclusion in that program is
not a claim of completed source integration.

## Source integrations

| Workstream | Current state | Bounded claim |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FAC | Root source composed; corpus review closed | The full 661-target review is dispositioned. The dossier records 37 independently written theorem or lemma additions, bounded source corrections, successful validators, builds, and targeted visual inspection. |
| Tôhoku | Historical comparison/draft-proof dossier; source integration incomplete | The dossier covers satellites under effacement hypotheses, cohomology with families of supports, and equivariant cohomology and Ext spectral sequences. Several corresponding proof labels are absent from the current readable source, and the proposed weaker-hypothesis composite-functor spectral sequence is not composed. See the [concrete integration gap](ROADMAP.md#tohoku-source-integration-gap). |
| GAGA | Root chapter composed through r3; corpus review closed | All 126 source units are classified and all 79 substantive units have reviewed decisions. The live 23-page English chapter and deterministic mapping replay pass. |
| FGA | Root additions composed and notation-normalized; corpus review closed | The combined source contains the normalized FGA additions and post-merge dossier. The closure covers 1,253 units, 1,612 term links, and 579 append-only decisions; the recorded fixed-point Moduli build is 83 pages. |
| EGA | Partial root-source composition; direct-source review active | The comparison reaches §7.1.9.1: generic morphism germs, rational-function rings, finite-component products, Artinianness and minimal-prime localization. Next: §7.1.10. Existing Stacks coverage is reused; source editions remain separate read-only inputs. |
| Verdier | One proposition composed; remaining thesis open | Chapter II, Proposition 1.2.13 supplies the obstruction to functorial cone choices. This is not full-thesis integration. |

The [EGA I §6.6.4 source checkpoint](validation/ega-i-6.6.4-source-checkpoint-2026-08-31.json)
binds the public proof completion. The [§6.6.5 candidate receipt](validation/ega-i-6.6.5-semantic-checkpoint-2026-09-06.json)
records the generic-point criterion using 01RL together with 004W and 01IS;
it does not equate the stronger EGA formulation with the statement of 01RL
alone. Its independent audit and semantic checker pass.

The earlier §6.6.3 semantic-only release remains preserved at GitHub tag
[`ega-i-6.6.3-semantic-2026-08-30`](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-ai-integrated-stacks-project/releases/tag/ega-i-6.6.3-semantic-2026-08-30)
and Zenodo version DOI [`10.5281/zenodo.22177421`](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22177421)
with six byte-matched assets totaling 182,415,449 bytes per host. Historical
release inventories are not a substitute for the current source checkpoint.

## Errata state

The generated [`Changes from Upstream`](CHANGES_FROM_UPSTREAM.md) index and
self-contained [`offline change browser`](ai-integrated/changes/index.html)
place the pinned original and integrated replacement side by side, with
direct evidence links and no annotations in the mathematical TeX. The
generated index is refreshed as part of each source-publication checkpoint;
its embedded source identity determines its coverage.

### R40–R47: cumulative source and combined build published

The new corrections repair descent-map domains and indices, source/target
conventions for groupoids, the centre's conjugation-equalizer formulation,
truncation shifts for perfect complexes, and site/topos and base-change
notation. They also include separately identifiable prose repairs.

Exactly **177 new operations** were applied to `descent.tex`, `groupoids.tex`,
`more-groupoids.tex`, `perfect.tex` and `topologies.tex`, preserving every
non-operation byte of the parent. The [independent receipt](validation/stacks-errata-a04446e-r47-independent-composition-2026-09-06.json)
reproduces source commit `b3c4a28c053dbbd45670dd19cf0dcc45063190dc`,
checks 26 registry imports and eight manifests, and records three unchanged
Groupoids findings separately rather than silently repairing them.

The [composition receipt](validation/composition-current.json) binds 48
overlays and 1,292 stable IDs: errata R1–R47 plus the 12-unit Verdier
contribution. These bookkeeping totals are not counts of new theorems.
The successor [build](validation/stacks-errata-a04446e-r47-illusie-build-2026-09-07.json),
[reproducibility comparison](validation/stacks-errata-a04446e-r47-illusie-reproducibility-2026-09-07.json)
and [bounded visual evidence](validation/stacks-errata-a04446e-r47-illusie-visual-qa-2026-09-07.json)
are public at the head above. The comparator matches all 35 PDF identities.
The historical EGA §6.6.4 receipt and earlier R47-only results remain intact.
This incremental GitHub checkpoint does not create a new Zenodo version.

### Historical R34–R38 source and build evidence

The new work corrects the directions of two cohomological comparison maps,
repairs indices and functor types in cohomology on sites, and fixes
commutative-algebra arguments involving minimal primes, localization, and
direct summands. Only the accepted edits were applied to `cohomology.tex`,
`sites-cohomology.tex`, and `more-algebra.tex`; earlier additions were
preserved, not replaced by isolated chapter payloads.

At that checkpoint the cumulative registry contained **39 overlays and 1,106 stable IDs**:
1,094 errata IDs through R38 plus the 12-unit Verdier contribution. R34–R38
add 77 accepted operations, of which 76 change source bytes. The remaining
operation, `MC-STK-ERR-1296-OP1`, is already satisfied by an earlier
structural rewrite and is not applied a second time. The cumulative exact
operation ledger contains 1,243 entries; these are not 1,243 new edits.

The historical composition recorded in Git and the
[independent replay](validation/stacks-errata-a04446e-r38-independent-composition-2026-08-31.json)
bind source commit `1242d514b71e60b4fe11b4c867f7de660f9a3b77` to the admitted
registry cutoff `69f14d67c3a456c3d1447e1a201bdfc3f3d87f0c`. Two builds
produce the same **30 PDFs, 3,005 pages, and 32,046,922 PDF bytes**. The
[completed visual review](validation/stacks-errata-a04446e-r38-visual-qa-2026-08-31.json)
covers all 681 affected-chapter pages in 44 contact sheets and all 42 enlarged
correction-bearing or preserved-evidence pages: 86 inspected images in total.

One visible layout residual is retained: on `cohomology.pdf` page 123, the
double-derived-Hom display extends 16.28908 pt beyond the text width but
remains inside the page, legible, and free of overlap or clipping. This is
not a claim of zero new box warnings.

A second nonblocking observation is the visible “Sheaves on Stacks,
Section ??” reference on `sites-cohomology.pdf` page 102. Its target,
`stacks-sheaves-section-QC`, is outside the selected 30-chapter build profile.
The reference is disclosed, not treated as a resolved internal link. These
builds do not establish reference completeness across all 116 chapters.

The [R38 clarification](ai-integrated/registry/admission-receipts/r38-clarification-0001.json)
also records that `MC-STK-ERR-1345` is equivalent summation notation, not a
substantive mathematical defect. It identifies the final manifest-bound
review where an older regeneration receipt retains a stale nested pointer;
the immutable candidate and admission history remain unchanged.

### Historical composition through R33

- The R33 integrated registry contained **34 overlays / 1,042 stable IDs**, frozen at
  the R33 successor `acb48c7edaf9595b542b003ed360399870188b7f`, tree
  `8356ae1652ae4ce6a22a457855072c5a3e7b3ad4`.
- The Stacks errata component is **R1–R33**: 33 batches, 1,030 stable
  correction IDs, and 1,166 exact v2 operations. `MC-STK-ERR-1294` is the
  highest identifier through R33; intentional gaps mean it is not a count of
  corrections.
- The 22nd overlay is the separately admitted historical-source contribution
  `stacks-verdier-a04446e-1-2-13-r1`, containing 12 non-official stable units.
  It inserts the manifest-bound Lemma 4.15 into cumulative `derived.tex` through
  a unique unchanged context. No official Stacks tag or upstream endorsement is
  claimed.
- The prior Stacks-only external registry cutoff is
  `13ca6aaaca454f5930c4885c93f427e30cf21959`; the integrated history preserves
  its byte-for-byte registry import and R1–R21 composition as historical state.
- R20 is composed into `derived.tex`. R21 is operation-replayed onto the
  verified cumulative `simplicial.tex`, preserving earlier AI-integrated
  additions outside its manifest-bound operations.
- The independent `injectives.tex` parenthesis correction is included in the
  live source and retained in Git history.
- R22 and R23 are composed in registry order by replaying their manifest-bound
  operations onto cumulative `more-algebra.tex`; neither isolated payload
  replaces the integrated source. The rejected producer `MORE-ALGEBRA-J-006`
  remains excluded.
- R24 is composed by replaying only its 57 manifest-bound operations onto
  cumulative `spaces-duality.tex`; its isolated payload does not replace the
  integrated source. The committed 80,995-byte postimage has SHA-256
  `3CFCEF73EB9172CF69082FF07B9D84442DD5E545D8AD22917D5A694BAA57298E`.
- R25 is composed by replaying only its 154 manifest-bound operations onto
  cumulative `artin.tex`; its isolated payload does not replace the integrated
  source. The committed 254,488-byte postimage has SHA-256
  `F196752E6D872B3B888E57C7183B326287F1A241286991C075E4896996FD185B`.
  The composition is commit `63dfd5f1499bea1916f64256056a5a37bcfb8f9a`,
  tree `7ab863452c932dd5ef230f65abdfa5bdcd6b5771`.
- R26 is composed by replaying only its 39 manifest-bound operations onto
  cumulative `smoothing.tex`; its isolated payload does not replace the
  integrated source. The committed 134,830-byte postimage has SHA-256
  `85251479BB7D35D73CD5691C194D33B3ADC1BF245BCC248643D969DBBA0E7928`.
  Candidate commit `d1f8c1b4654e8d63ea6380dfb5d2e256a6982121` has tree
  `aca634a2dc857f97f6deb52cf4da5ba0792d6d23` and candidate subtree
  `cc94b817fabf54d21c4914e5b7ebf8f168bac807`; registry import
  `ca00b6023be95e0e928d5c0380e24011756bb0ef` precedes composition commit
  `47c6b78e476e5644f5a7d0ca2ce4816b144a2411`, tree
  `cbad56973a9e594743b596a5fd0fa291b490ae26`.
- R26 adjudication accepted 31 producer identities, aliased
  `SMOOTHING-002/003/004` to their existing R1 corrections, rejected
  `SMOOTHING-010`, and merged four repeated semantic groups before
  materializing 25 new stable units.
- R27 is composed by replaying only its 14 manifest-bound operations onto the
  verified cumulative FAC-expanded `modules.tex`; its isolated authority
  projection does not replace the integrated source. The committed 211,777-byte
  postimage has SHA-256
  `BA34DCC89DCEE1BD5F0B9D3C986B18EE9618F723C10E7C7FD3DBD80E9E0B2300`.
  The append-only topology is lease `1f05772d6f46ab851cdecdf53b70c11ea698cb14`,
  candidate `77fcc9fc2341e72b077224399743f1062e73b228`, admission
  `8c0539a6a7aa001cc6152daee92d5c7a49bf6a93`, linear import
  `f3bfc1b987ac9defc1b7811650bac0ec84a01373`, and composition
  `5a42b7d2a04c4d08be7861ec91306d8be05d631e`.
- R28 is composed by replaying the one active last-wins replacement onto the
  verified cumulative `smoothing.tex`; its isolated payload is evidence only.
  The registry import is `1c26a825306ba0d14607e8364b49125ed3de39b5`
  and the source composition is `1ed5b9fce0f75dec5ad551d32badd8e99abf058a`,
  tree `28c377be399e04fb75f7568000c62e5cfafa291f`. The 134,835-byte postimage
  has SHA-256 `85A37C95D5591632D11E7BE6775039638B6F5200B44729ABCEA1A644D9F5B056`.
- R29 was admitted at `8b70e94d7d9a1f28041445e52df03bffd2980435`
  and received an append-only transport repair at the R30 cutoff
  `256846d6a4193f21cd6e1af675dc09e6950aa3d6`. Its 31 manifest-bound
  operations produce cumulative `sites-modules.tex` at 312,179 bytes / SHA-256
  `B097799584BD00B3D8046F62A0A56FCFE045516FD04D130C2A4C547CE3BB6C19`.
- R30 contributes 40 stable IDs and 40 operations affecting only
  `injectives.tex`. The 105,225-byte cumulative postimage has SHA-256
  `BDC721593BE0B491334C707B371A2EECD1787787903A71E059721BDB66C5AC04`;
  already-present operation `MC-STK-ERR-1262-OP1` was preserved. The R29/R30
  registry import is `6df0e967030bcf818f3c49584fa5e9a992278d75`; exact source composition is
  `3e57820736a5a57ddb1c9fbaaf2206e455b5ee31`, tree
  `c4ce1faf96257fe11c0123ca649c9c020982aa33`, followed by validation binding
  `c521604343534f94c7a59086c94b99712eb1d754`.
- R31 contributes one stable ID and one operation affecting cumulative
  `sites-modules.tex`; R32 materializes 103 historical IDs as 125 operations
  across `fields.tex`, `categories.tex`, and `algebra.tex`; R33 adds seven
  operations to `spaces-morphisms.tex`. The R33 registry chain is imported at
  `b2ffa008fc27bfdb8b93c431f4df0c3e197d3440`, and exact source composition is

## Validation state

R40–R47 is included in the published combined checkpoint, with the current
build, reproducibility and bounded visual receipts linked above. EGA
§6.6.6–§6.6.8 passes its separate semantic and full repository checks without
changing root source. Historical R38/R39 results remain evidence only for
their own source identities. See [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md).

Per-corpus build and visual receipts remain linked from the detailed dossiers;
they are not silently generalized beyond their recorded source identity.

### Historical R33 validation and public release

The R33 gate built all 28 required chapters (2,730 pages and
29,277,302 PDF bytes) to a global PDF fixed point on sweep four. It is bound to
source `1c90a67eb42de28884be05abd8fb58f781aed7db`, tree
`3c292f9a4b94162ede69d2633b1272b057a498c3`, and records zero fatal,
missing-glyph, undefined-reference, undefined-citation, multiply-defined,
rerun-required, or destination-warning diagnostics. Visual QA passed all 116
pages of `spaces-morphisms.pdf`, including all five unique
manifest-bound locus pages at 180 DPI. The exact artifact inventory is in the
[historical R33 fixed-point build receipt](validation/stacks-errata-a04446e-r33-build-2026-08-30.json).

The [parallel linked-worktree reproducibility gate](validation/stacks-errata-a04446e-r33-reproducibility-2026-08-30.json)
is **PASS**. Both builds use the same commit, tree, builder, environment, and
fixed-point sweep; all 28 `{stem, pages, bytes, sha256}` artifact tuples are
exactly equal. Earlier R24, R22/R23, Verdier, and R21 receipts remain preserved
as historical evidence for their exact source identities and scopes.

The [historical R33 publication receipt](validation/stacks-errata-a04446e-r33-release-2026-08-30.json)
binds the public commit and tree, successful exact-head workflow, identical
six-file current package across GitHub and Zenodo, the three inherited Zenodo
R30 ZIPs, anonymous SHA-256 readback, and archive-member replay. The R30, R28,
and R27 receipts remain historical evidence for their immutable versions.
