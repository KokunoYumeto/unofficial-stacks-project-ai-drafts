# Unofficial Stacks Project AI Drafts

[![Repository validation](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/actions/workflows/validate.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/actions/workflows/validate.yml)

## Why this project exists

This repository is a collection of unofficial, AI-written drafts for possible
later human use. It is not a campaign for the Stacks Project to accept AI
contributions, and it is not a claim that these drafts are ready to become
part of the canonical Stacks Project.

The practical idea is modest: editable LaTeX editions of important
French-school sources make it possible to compare those works with the Stacks
Project, identify material that may still be useful, and prepare draft
statements and proofs in Stacks-style LaTeX. The drafts are left here so that
Stacks contributors—or other mathematicians—can inspect, correct, reuse, or
mine them if and when someone with the relevant expertise has time to do so.

The inputs include editable LaTeX editions of major French-school works:

- **Serre, FAC — *Faisceaux algébriques cohérents*:** [French diplomatic TeX](https://zenodo.org/records/22074486/files/01b_FAC_French_Diplomatic_Body.tex?download=1) · [complete French/English source package](https://zenodo.org/records/22074486/files/19_FAC_Project_English_and_French_TeX_Source_Layers.zip?download=1).

- **Verdier, *Des catégories dérivées des catégories abéliennes*:** [editable source package](https://zenodo.org/records/21968574/files/source.zip?download=1).

These are independently maintained transcriptions or editions, not original
author-produced LaTeX. The integration records pin the particular source
versions used; the linked editions may continue to develop.

We understand why a human-maintained project may choose not to rely on
AI-generated material. Maintaining mathematics requires people who can
understand, explain, repair, and extend the proofs; producing a plausible
draft does not transfer that expertise to its future maintainers. Until a
qualified reader has checked an addition and is prepared to understand and
maintain it, it should be treated as an external draft—not as part of the
human-maintained Stacks corpus.

> [!IMPORTANT]

## What is actually in the draft?

The examples below name classical results and explain what was added here.
They are not claims that the underlying mathematics is new. **Integrated**
means the statement and proof are present in this branch’s readable LaTeX,
not merely mentioned in a tracking file.

### FAC: new explicit statements, proofs, and source corrections — integrated

The full article has been compared with Stacks. Results already covered were
mapped rather than rewritten; selected missing formulations and proofs were
added. Notable examples include:

- **Graded local duality** — Chapter III §4, no. 72, Theorem 1: an explicit
  graded-module formulation relating Koszul–Čech cohomology to graded Ext,
  including the exceptional kernel–cokernel sequence and its degree range.
  [Statement and proof](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/blob/6c5f549dcdec6051dfeaf0e5300faf3b80576830/more-algebra.tex#L7692).
- **Cohomology of projective complete intersections** — Chapter III §5,
  no. 78, Proposition 5: calculations for all twists, intermediate-cohomology
  vanishing, and top-cohomology duality. The draft separates the
  zero-dimensional exception to the source’s section-isomorphism claim and
  supplies the appropriate exact sequence.
  [Statement, correction, and proof](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/blob/6c5f549dcdec6051dfeaf0e5300faf3b80576830/coherent.tex#L4774).
- **Degree of the Hilbert polynomial equals dimension of support** —
  Chapter III §6, no. 81, Proposition 6: a consolidated statement and proof
  over an arbitrary field, assembled from existing Stacks ingredients.
  [Statement and proof](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/blob/6c5f549dcdec6051dfeaf0e5300faf3b80576830/varieties.tex#L7018).

### GAGA: the projective algebraic–analytic comparison — integrated chapter

The new [GAGA chapter](gaga.tex) develops Serre’s three central theorems from
§3, no. 12:

- **Cohomology comparison:** algebraic and analytic coherent-sheaf cohomology
  agree on complex projective varieties.
  [Theorem 1](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/blob/6c5f549dcdec6051dfeaf0e5300faf3b80576830/gaga.tex#L1051) · [proof](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/blob/6c5f549dcdec6051dfeaf0e5300faf3b80576830/gaga.tex#L1236).
- **Full faithfulness:** analytic homomorphisms between analytified coherent
  sheaves come uniquely from algebraic homomorphisms.
  [Theorem 2](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/blob/6c5f549dcdec6051dfeaf0e5300faf3b80576830/gaga.tex#L1071) · [proof](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/blob/6c5f549dcdec6051dfeaf0e5300faf3b80576830/gaga.tex#L1309).
- **Algebraization:** every coherent analytic sheaf on a complex projective
  variety comes from an algebraic coherent sheaf. The argument develops
  analytic twisting and global generation before algebraizing a finite
  presentation.
  [Theorem 3](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/blob/6c5f549dcdec6051dfeaf0e5300faf3b80576830/gaga.tex#L1087) · [global-generation argument](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/blob/6c5f549dcdec6051dfeaf0e5300faf3b80576830/gaga.tex#L1444).

Applications include [Chow’s theorem](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/blob/6c5f549dcdec6051dfeaf0e5300faf3b80576830/gaga.tex#L1660) and
[algebraicity of holomorphic maps](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/blob/6c5f549dcdec6051dfeaf0e5300faf3b80576830/gaga.tex#L1748).
This does **not** reconstruct every analytic foundation: Oka–Cartan coherence,
Weierstrass theory, Dolbeault computations, and related external inputs are
identified explicitly. [Scope and source comparison](gaga_r3/STATUS.md).

### FGA: Quot schemes, algebraization, and categorical foundations — integrated

- **Projective Quot schemes** — Exposé 221, Theorem 3.2 and Proposition 3.8:
  a Grassmannian construction proves that the fixed-Hilbert-polynomial Quot
  space is a projective scheme, with a very ample determinant bundle. This
  strengthens the inherited proper-algebraic-space conclusion in this setting.
  [Theorem and proof](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/blob/6c5f549dcdec6051dfeaf0e5300faf3b80576830/moduli.tex#L1573).
- **Algebraizing formal families and lifting smooth varieties** — Exposé
  182, Theorem 4 and Corollaries 3–4: algebraization with projective special
  fibre and vanishing second structure-sheaf cohomology, followed by a
  deformation-theoretic lifting criterion and the smooth-curve case.
  [Algebraization](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/blob/6c5f549dcdec6051dfeaf0e5300faf3b80576830/coherent.tex#L9031) ·
  [lifting criterion](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/blob/6c5f549dcdec6051dfeaf0e5300faf3b80576830/defos.tex#L2536) ·
  [curves](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/blob/6c5f549dcdec6051dfeaf0e5300faf3b80576830/defos.tex#L2603).
- **Recovering categories and groupoids from their nerves** — Exposé 212,
  Proposition 4.1 and Corollary 4.2: full faithfulness of the nerve, the Segal
  characterization of its image, and the equivalence “groupoid iff nerve is
  Kan,” including an internal finite-limit version.
  [Nerve and Segal theorem](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/blob/6c5f549dcdec6051dfeaf0e5300faf3b80576830/simplicial.tex#L953) ·
  [groupoid/Kan theorem](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/blob/6c5f549dcdec6051dfeaf0e5300faf3b80576830/simplicial.tex#L5796).

### EGA: selected scheme-theoretic additions — partial, ongoing

EGA is **not fully integrated**. This tree's reviewed comparison reaches
EGA I §7.1.16, completing the comparison of §7.1; the next source unit is
§7.2.1. The earlier §6.6.4 contribution
completes the base-change proof for quasi-compact morphisms at Stacks tag
01K5. Sections 6.6.5–6.6.8 connect the generic-point criterion for dominance,
permanence of locally finite-type morphisms, locally Noetherian fibre products,
and geometric-point tests to existing Stacks results, with their precise
hypotheses retained. These comparisons add no duplicate root theorem.
Sections 7.1.1–7.1.3 explain rational maps, rational sections, and the ring
of rational functions using the existing Stacks definitions. The comparison
also corrects an overstatement in EGA's printed restriction argument:
representatives agree on a dense open witness, not necessarily on their
entire overlap. The original remains available for comparison; the draft
gives the corrected argument and an explicit counterexample to the stronger
claim. See the [rational-map comparison](ega/README.md#rational-maps-and-functions).
Sections 7.1.4–7.1.9.1 identify rational maps with germs at generic points,
express rational functions as a finite product of generic local rings, and
deduce Artinianness for Noetherian schemes. For an affine scheme with finitely
many components, they identify rational functions with localization away from
the minimal primes—not automatically the total quotient ring. The
[written comparison](ega/i719.md) gives the derivations, their precise
hypotheses, and counterexamples; these results reuse existing Stacks content.
Sections 7.1.10–7.1.14 explain when a rational map is determined by its
generic local scheme, distinguish finite-type uniqueness from
finite-presentation existence, and show why localization at a point preserves
the rational-map set under the stated hypotheses. The [comparison](ega/i714.md)
keeps the base-scheme structure and possible nilpotents explicit.
The concluding corollaries 7.1.15–7.1.16 identify rational maps from an integral
scheme with points valued in its function field. The [comparison](ega/i716.md)
retains the chosen residue-field embedding and its compatibility with the base.
It also explains why EGA's historical “geometric point” here is not the modern
algebraically-closed-field convention. Existing Stacks results apply under weaker
hypotheses; no duplicate theorem or formal-proof claim is introduced.
See the [validation and publication states](STATUS.md).
Other concrete additions already in the draft include:

- **The Jacobson-radical neighbourhood lemma** — EGA I, Proposition 1.1.15:
  an open subset of an affine spectrum containing the closed set of an ideal
  in the Jacobson radical is the whole spectrum.
  [Named lemma and proof](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/blob/6c5f549dcdec6051dfeaf0e5300faf3b80576830/algebra.tex#L3628).
- **A spectrum-embedding criterion** — EGA I, Corollary 1.2.4:
  a unit-times-image condition on a ring map makes its spectrum map a
  homeomorphism onto its image.
  [Statement and proof](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/blob/6c5f549dcdec6051dfeaf0e5300faf3b80576830/algebra.tex#L3172).
- **Four equivalent quasi-coherence criteria** — EGA I, Theorem 1.4.1:
  a consolidated theorem for quasi-compact opens of affine schemes, relating
  extension from an ambient module and localization of global sections.
  [Statement and proof](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/blob/6c5f549dcdec6051dfeaf0e5300faf3b80576830/properties.tex#L2483).

### Verdier: an obstruction to functorial cones — one proposition integrated

**Astérisque 239, Chapter II, Proposition 1.2.13:** a functorial choice of
distinguished cone triangles, together with countable products or coproducts,
forces every morphism to decompose as a split projection followed by a split
inclusion. The draft adds the functoriality argument and connects it to
existing Stacks results on splitting idempotents and decomposability.
[Statement and proof](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-stacks-project-ai-drafts/blob/6c5f549dcdec6051dfeaf0e5300faf3b80576830/derived.tex#L825).
This is one bounded contribution, not an integration of the whole thesis.

### Tôhoku: substantial comparison and draft-proof work — not fully integrated

The preserved research dossier records work on difficult parts of
Grothendieck’s paper, including **right satellites under injective-effacement
hypotheses** (Theorem 2.2.2), **Leray spectral sequences with families of
supports** (Theorem 3.7.3), and **equivariant Čech comparison and Ext spectral
sequences** (Theorems 5.5.6 and 5.6.3).

However, several proofs referenced by that historical dossier are absent from
this branch’s current LaTeX. The composite-functor spectral sequence here also
still has stronger hypotheses than the dossier’s proposed version.
**The entire paper must not be counted as integrated.** Results already in
official Stacks—such as enough injectives in a Grothendieck category—are
existing coverage, not AI contributions.

[Concrete integration gap](ROADMAP.md#tohoku-source-integration-gap).

### Corrections to the inherited Stacks text — integrated with comparisons

The draft also corrects mathematical typing, indices, references, and prose.
Examples include:

- **Naive cotangent-complex functoriality:** correcting which cotangent
  complex is pulled back and which is the target of the comparison map.
  [Original and replacement](CHANGES_FROM_UPSTREAM.md#mc-stk-err-1214).
- **Localization at an object of a site:** using the sheaf category of the
  slice site in place of an unrelated quotient topos in the proof.
  [Original and replacement](CHANGES_FROM_UPSTREAM.md#mc-stk-err-1287).
- **Functoriality of derived internal Hom:** restoring a missing arrow in a
  distinguished triangle and correcting the direction of a comparison map.
  [Triangle](CHANGES_FROM_UPSTREAM.md#mc-stk-err-1297) ·
  [comparison map](CHANGES_FROM_UPSTREAM.md#mc-stk-err-1312).
- **Commutative-algebra proofs:** repairing mismatched ring indices,
  localization subscripts, and the use of all minimal primes in a
  reduced-ring injection. These are local corrections, not replacement
  proofs of the entire chapter.
  [Chapter-by-chapter comparisons](ai-integrated/changes/index.html).

Not every edit is a mathematical error correction: some improve prose or
normalize equivalent notation. For example, the two summation conventions
in [MC-STK-ERR-1345](CHANGES_FROM_UPSTREAM.md#mc-stk-err-1345) mean the same
thing. [The classification clarification](ai-integrated/registry/admission-receipts/r38-clarification-0001.json)
records that distinction explicitly.

[Browse every recorded correction](CHANGES_FROM_UPSTREAM.md). This comparison
places the pinned original beside the replacement and links the source,
rationale, and review evidence. The [offline HTML browser](ai-integrated/changes/index.html)
adds search and chapter filters. The original
[official Stacks snapshot](https://github.com/stacks/stacks-project/tree/a04446e57ec1fbc252a871afcec7752fb2807b14)
remains directly accessible.

## Read, inspect, and reproduce

Start with a theorem above, inspect its proof and dependencies, then compare it
with the historical source and the upstream Stacks text. There is no expectation
that a reader accept a result because an AI or an automated check produced it.
