# Unified-build receipts

## Current combined R47/Illusie evidence

The combined source and these receipts are public at
`5817f4c1af8724b147401c785f57ca315b52e31c`. The
[build](stacks-errata-a04446e-r47-illusie-build-2026-09-07.json) and
[independent second build](stacks-errata-a04446e-r47-illusie-repro-build-2026-09-07.json)
are compared by the [reproducibility receipt](stacks-errata-a04446e-r47-illusie-reproducibility-2026-09-07.json):
35 matching PDF identities, 3,363 pages and 36,679,971 bytes per run.
The [visual receipt](stacks-errata-a04446e-r47-illusie-visual-qa-2026-09-07.json)
retains its actual five-chapter R47 scope and historical observations. It is
not an assertion that every page in the combined corpus was visually reviewed.

The newer [EGA I §6.6.6–§6.6.8 validation](ega-i-6.6.6-6.6.8-integration-validation-2026-09-07.json)
checks existing mathematical coverage and hypothesis boundaries. It changes no
root TeX or PDF input; all 35 retained PDF hashes were reread successfully.
The immutable candidate receipt's old pending state is distinguished from
the later validation and publication records.

The [anonymous GitHub readback](ega-i-6.6.6-6.6.8-public-readback-2026-09-07.json)
verifies all 15 changed files at public content commit
`27947f240bbe0fed5cf7e91239a1ebe238a85bb2`, totaling 1,888,511 bytes.
This is an incremental GitHub checkpoint, not a new Zenodo version.

## Current EGA I §7.1.4–§7.1.9.1 comparison

The [integration validation](ega-i-7.1.4-7.1.9.1-integration-validation-2026-09-07.json),
[source-bound checkpoint](ega-i-7.1.4-7.1.9.1-semantic-checkpoint-2026-09-07.json)
and [written derivations](../ega/i719.md) compare generic morphism germs and
rational-function rings, including all separately owned proof passages.
Existing Stacks results supply the mathematics; no duplicate root theorem
or new PDF is introduced. The next source unit is §7.1.10.

## Preceding EGA I §7.1.1–§7.1.3 comparison

The preceding [EGA I §7.1.1–§7.1.3 integration validation](ega-i-7.1.1-7.1.3-integration-validation-2026-09-07.json)
records the rational-map and rational-function comparison. Its
[source-boundary correction](ega-i-7.1.1-7.1.3-source-boundary-correction-2026-09-07.json)
supersedes incomplete raw-source intervals while preserving the first
candidate and its ledger rows as adverse history. Live French/English replay,
73 test executions and complete repository validation pass. The next source
unit at that checkpoint was §7.1.4; those tests did not prove EGA complete.

The [public content readback](ega-i-7.1.1-7.1.3-public-readback-2026-09-07.json)
verifies all 22 changed paths at `51e93aef77d61a0b1ba766534ac46e563961c93c`,
totaling 2,003,438 bytes. A test-history repair binds the preserved public
predecessor rather than requiring an unpublished local candidate commit;
the mathematical comparison and immutable source receipts are unchanged.

## Historical R38 composition and build checkpoint

The following describes its original pre-publication state, not current main.

The local source includes admitted R34–R38 corrections on top of the public
R33 source. Independent composition replay, two byte-identical builds, and
visual review pass with the observations below. **R38 is not yet published.** R33,
described below, remains the latest public errata release, and no R38 DOI,
successful publication workflow, or anonymous public readback is asserted.

The current evidence is:

- [Composition receipt](composition-current.json): registry cutoff
  `69f14d67c3a456c3d1447e1a201bdfc3f3d87f0c`, source commit
  `1242d514b71e60b4fe11b4c867f7de660f9a3b77`, 39 overlays and 1,106 stable
  IDs (1,094 errata IDs plus 12 Verdier units).
- [Independent cumulative replay](stacks-errata-a04446e-r38-independent-composition-2026-08-31.json):
  all 77 accepted operations accounted for, with 76 exact byte edits across
  `cohomology.tex`, `sites-cohomology.tex`, and `more-algebra.tex`. The one
  historical structural no-op, `MC-STK-ERR-1296-OP1`, is already satisfied
  and was not reapplied. Forward replay matches the complete sources;
  reverse replay recovers the parent and preserves earlier additions.
- [First fixed-point build](stacks-errata-a04446e-r38-build-2026-08-31.json),
  [second build](stacks-errata-a04446e-r38-reproducibility-second-2026-08-31.json),
  and [reproducibility comparison](stacks-errata-a04446e-r38-reproducibility-2026-08-31.json):
  all 30 PDF identities match, totaling 3,005 pages and 32,046,922 bytes in
  each run. Both reach a global fixed point on sweep four at build source
  `bb6e7ccca41fe00a06815d81e174c5261e7a1ce3`, tree
  `bfcfa4103af8bb253cac76ffacf791147ea7c683`.
- [Source-to-page map](stacks-errata-a04446e-r38-source-page-map-2026-08-31.json):
  no mapping failures; it binds the 76 changed operations and the historical
  no-op to the exact PDFs.
- [Completed visual review](stacks-errata-a04446e-r38-visual-qa-2026-08-31.json):
  PASS for all 681 affected-chapter pages in 44 contact sheets and all 42
  enlarged correction-bearing or preserved-evidence pages, totaling 86
  inspected images. The two nonblocking observations remain explicit.

The visible nonblocking layout residual is the double-derived-Hom display
on `cohomology.pdf` page 123: 16.28908 pt beyond the text width, but within
the page, legible, and without overlap or clipping. A successful build does
not establish zero new box warnings.

On `sites-cohomology.pdf` page 102, “Sheaves on Stacks, Section ??” is a
visible external-reference residual. Its target, `stacks-sheaves-section-QC`,
is outside the selected 30-chapter build profile, not an undefined internal
reference. This visual PASS is not a claim of reference completeness across
all 116 chapters.

The [R38 admission clarification](../ai-integrated/registry/admission-receipts/r38-clarification-0001.json)
preserves the immutable candidate while classifying `MC-STK-ERR-1345` as
equivalent summation notation, not a substantive mathematical defect. It
also identifies the final manifest-bound review behind an older receipt's
stale nested pointer; the original historical evidence remains unchanged.

## Historical R21 build receipts

The preserved historical R21 build gate is recorded at the automation-stable path
[`unified-fixed-point-2026-08-25-r19.json`](unified-fixed-point-2026-08-25-r19.json).
The historical-looking filename is retained for automation compatibility; its
JSON schema, composition binding, source commit, and source tree define scope.
The earlier [`R1–R15 receipt`](unified-build-2026-08-25.json) remains preserved
as historical evidence for its exact source tree.

It binds the unified source commit and tree to:

- admitted errata replay through R21;
- all R4–R21 immutable manifest checks;
- all 591 exact v2 operations, including 43 new R20–R21 operations and the
  120-operation bounded R18–R21 replay, plus 69 earlier replacements, nine R1
  tag additions, and 21,819 unique permanent tags;
- exact cumulative identities for both `derived.tex` and `simplicial.tex`;
- EGA scaffold and pinned-map checks; and
- separate linked-worktree fixed-point builds of all 22 receipt-selected chapters.

All 22 PDFs (2,342 pages; 24,385,554 bytes) compiled successfully, were readable
by `pdfinfo`, and reached a global fixed point on sweep four from tooling/build
source `8e9520aa30e0d538e71e787850bac91f5ddb35f9`, tree
`c63e22c9ec1fef6d5af3820f5f83bd316e51ae62`. The aggregate serious diagnostic
classes are zero. PDF bytes are build artifacts; the committed receipt records
their page counts, byte counts, SHA-256 identities, and diagnostics without
placing generated binaries in the source tree.

Visual QA passed all 202 review pages and the affected-page superset. The
independent linked-worktree rebuild also passed with the same commit, tree, builder, and
fixed-point sweep; all 22 `{stem, pages, bytes, sha256}` tuples are exactly
equal. Its [`reproducibility-second-r21.json`](reproducibility-second-r21.json)
full receipt is 19,440 bytes with SHA-256
`7DC3A3EEAA932B8804CC826D52FE0892445CE883FE27AF362A873392B7CA171A`.
The public [`reproducibility-r21.json`](reproducibility-r21.json) summary is
5,977 bytes with SHA-256
`A28E2D9DF4E333B052FBD1EA884F7585A9D07423B3EB98004B511C2EC8C75687`.
The [publication receipt](errata-r18-r19-release-2026-08-25.json) binds these
gates to public content head `780f48fafbb46dc1057bf8fdcd339693fb44d6bf` and
records anonymous readback of the decisive public inventory.

## Historical Verdier v4 receipts

The Verdier release advanced the integrated registry to 22 overlays and 559
stable IDs by adding the independently written
`stacks-verdier-a04446e-1-2-13-r1` overlay after the historical R1–R21
composition. Its preserved evidence includes:

- [`stacks-verdier-a04446e-1-2-13-r1-build-2026-08-26.json`](stacks-verdier-a04446e-1-2-13-r1-build-2026-08-26.json)
  — 22 PDFs, 2,343 pages, 24,390,066 bytes, fixed point at sweep four, and zero
  listed serious diagnostics;
- [`stacks-verdier-a04446e-1-2-13-r1-visual-qa-2026-08-26.json`](stacks-verdier-a04446e-1-2-13-r1-visual-qa-2026-08-26.json)
  — all 130 affected pages reviewed, plus pages 9–11 at high resolution;
- [`stacks-verdier-a04446e-1-2-13-r1-reproducibility-2026-08-26.json`](stacks-verdier-a04446e-1-2-13-r1-reproducibility-2026-08-26.json)
  — exact equality of all 22 artifact identities across two parallel,
  independent linked-worktree builds; and
- the [Verdier publication receipt](stacks-verdier-a04446e-1-2-13-r1-release-2026-08-26.json),
  which binds public content head
  `4947e4a6d22971ea793e4b4bc2b09d8ab8cc04d0` to its passing workflow and
  anonymous readback inventory.

The historical R21 and Verdier receipts remain authoritative for their own
immutable snapshots. They are deliberately not treated as proof for the later
R22/R23 source tree.

## Historical R22/R23 receipts

The R22/R23 validated composition advanced the registry to 24 overlays and 652
stable IDs at cutoff `49fc23ab2f3d94cc98f27bc0f315fb0da6f2c98a`. The Stacks
errata subset is R1–R23: 23 batches, 640 correction IDs, and 697 exact v2
operations. R22 and R23 contribute 93 IDs and 106 operations affecting only
`more-algebra.tex`. Its historical evidence is recorded in:

- [`stacks-errata-a04446e-r22-r23-build-2026-08-27.json`](stacks-errata-a04446e-r22-r23-build-2026-08-27.json)
  — source `1e9771352840bd70224027d13e9b32546838ccd2`, tree
  `4a3b7398f7607b73ee5596d359e5cf7a401c2256`, 22 PDFs, 2,343 pages,
  24,389,773 bytes, fixed point at sweep four, and zero listed serious
  diagnostics;
- [`stacks-errata-a04446e-r22-r23-visual-qa-2026-08-27.json`](stacks-errata-a04446e-r22-r23-visual-qa-2026-08-27.json)
  — all 406 `more-algebra.pdf` pages reviewed and 63 correction-locus pages
  inspected at high resolution; and
- [`stacks-errata-a04446e-r22-r23-reproducibility-2026-08-27.json`](stacks-errata-a04446e-r22-r23-reproducibility-2026-08-27.json)
  together with the [second full receipt](stacks-errata-a04446e-r22-r23-reproducibility-second-2026-08-27.json)
  — exact equality of all 22 artifact identities across two independent linked
  worktree builds; and
- [`stacks-errata-a04446e-r22-r23-release-2026-08-27.json`](stacks-errata-a04446e-r22-r23-release-2026-08-27.json)
  — public content head `3c2b49fe0d20519de4ab06951ac2cb5151b68782`, successful
  exact-head CI, and anonymous byte/hash/blob readback of 138 files totaling
  25,024,008 bytes.

These receipts remain authoritative for their immutable R22/R23 source tree;
they are not build or publication evidence for the later R24 composition.

## Historical R24 composition and validation receipts

The historical validated source composition advanced the registry to **25
overlays / 690 stable IDs** at R24 admission cutoff
`6df734ecb3bef8f35770819d17a8d3e267b8e07a`, tree
`49b8e57e91f0bf04669b2ee93e3586cfb6919088`. The Stacks errata subset is
R1–R24: 24 batches, 678 correction IDs, and 754 exact v2 operations. R24 adds
38 IDs and 57 manifest-bound operations affecting only `spaces-duality.tex`.

The preserved R24 build and release receipts bind that cutoff, imported
candidate and registry bytes, exact operation replay, earlier source identities,
and source commit `10c1c62f371921cdafbaa5e89f438a821a013621`, tree
`6ec98b8ee6919070a24130877d4eeb9e1a0e874b`.

The historical R24 evidence is recorded in:

- [`stacks-errata-a04446e-r24-build-2026-08-27.json`](stacks-errata-a04446e-r24-build-2026-08-27.json)
  — source `c3bc402b03dea3c5ac92c9e226645b5895a78887`, tree
  `626b67a2c32f4b2bc1b8ad7b4586cdb036b25a21`, 23 PDFs, 2,368 pages,
  24,949,361 bytes, fixed point on sweep four, and zero listed serious
  diagnostics;
- [`stacks-errata-a04446e-r24-visual-qa-2026-08-27.json`](stacks-errata-a04446e-r24-visual-qa-2026-08-27.json)
  — all 25 pages of `spaces-duality.pdf` inspected at high resolution with
  zero recorded rendering defects; and
- [`stacks-errata-a04446e-r24-reproducibility-2026-08-27.json`](stacks-errata-a04446e-r24-reproducibility-2026-08-27.json)
  together with the [second full receipt](stacks-errata-a04446e-r24-reproducibility-second-2026-08-27.json)
  — exact equality of all 23 artifact identities across two independent linked
  worktree builds.

The [R24 release receipt](stacks-errata-a04446e-r24-release-2026-08-27.json)
binds public content head `50438757de89ec6e67385084d4a2d578707f5a37` to
its passing exact-head workflow and anonymous readback of 86 checked files
totaling 5,155,955 bytes, including both candidate PDFs.

The subsequent
[`ai-integrated-stacks-r24-publication-2026-08-28.json`](ai-integrated-stacks-r24-publication-2026-08-28.json)
preserves that validated R24 state as one six-asset package on both GitHub and
Zenodo. It records concept DOI `10.5281/zenodo.22135180`, version DOI
`10.5281/zenodo.22135181`, exact public downloads, and byte/SHA-256 equality
across both hosts.

## Historical R25 composition and validation receipts

The historical R25 composition advanced the registry to **26
overlays / 821 stable IDs** at R25 admission cutoff
`001f36d41504aecfa77201a04fedff16d37b00f0`, tree
`f8e3a8ea8d7e95190b3cb4d21eb701a6709f90c7`. The Stacks errata subset is
R1–R25: 25 batches, 809 correction IDs, and 908 exact v2 operations. R25 adds
131 IDs and 154 manifest-bound operations affecting only `artin.tex`.

The preserved R25 build and release receipts bind that cutoff, imported
candidate and registry bytes, exact operation replay, earlier source identities,
and source commit `63dfd5f1499bea1916f64256056a5a37bcfb8f9a`, tree
`7ab863452c932dd5ef230f65abdfa5bdcd6b5771`.

The historical R25 evidence is recorded in:

- [`stacks-errata-a04446e-r25-build-2026-08-28.json`](stacks-errata-a04446e-r25-build-2026-08-28.json)
  — source `a13d609ba9b146eac0a72f593bcf8aff5c5a6a33`, tree
  `fbf8d6341b22298d05fdc1f72d547907bc164077`, 24 PDFs, 2,437 pages,
  25,862,634 bytes, fixed point on sweep four, and zero listed serious
  diagnostics;
- [`stacks-errata-a04446e-r25-visual-qa-2026-08-28.json`](stacks-errata-a04446e-r25-visual-qa-2026-08-28.json)
  — all 69 pages of `artin.pdf` reviewed and all 63 correction-locus pages
  inspected at high resolution with zero recorded rendering defects; and
- [`stacks-errata-a04446e-r25-reproducibility-2026-08-28.json`](stacks-errata-a04446e-r25-reproducibility-2026-08-28.json)
  together with the [second full receipt](stacks-errata-a04446e-r25-reproducibility-second-2026-08-28.json)
  — exact equality of all 24 artifact identities across two independent linked
  worktree builds.

The [R25 release receipt](stacks-errata-a04446e-r25-release-2026-08-28.json)
binds public content head `fb3e4cb4d834c4e28d84b6df41466ad8aaa71b42`
to its passing exact-head workflow and anonymous readback of 78 R25-changed
paths totaling 4,746,502 bytes. The subsequent
[`ai-integrated-stacks-r25-publication-2026-08-28.json`](ai-integrated-stacks-r25-publication-2026-08-28.json)
records the byte-identical six-asset GitHub and Zenodo release: 171,723,585
bytes, concept DOI `10.5281/zenodo.22135180`, and version DOI
`10.5281/zenodo.22143740`.

R25 remains publicly preserved as an immutable historical version in the same
GitHub release and Zenodo concept lineages.

## Historical R26 composition and validation receipts

The historical R26 source composition advanced the registry to **27
overlays / 846 stable IDs** at R26 admission cutoff
`a7c4a3c52b9a32e96e0f4b98f9579369026d9e1b`, tree
`93af84d65d7b250fe0f4d660782ccf330b9e4743`. The Stacks errata subset is
R1–R26: 26 batches, 834 correction IDs, and 947 exact v2 operations. R26 adds
25 IDs and 39 manifest-bound operations affecting only `smoothing.tex`; its
highest stable identifier is `MC-STK-ERR-1201`.

The historical R26 evidence binds final candidate commit
`d1f8c1b4654e8d63ea6380dfb5d2e256a6982121`, tree
`aca634a2dc857f97f6deb52cf4da5ba0792d6d23`, candidate subtree
`cc94b817fabf54d21c4914e5b7ebf8f168bac807`, registry import
`ca00b6023be95e0e928d5c0380e24011756bb0ef`, and source composition commit
`47c6b78e476e5644f5a7d0ca2ce4816b144a2411`, tree
`cbad56973a9e594743b596a5fd0fa291b490ae26`. The cumulative 134,830-byte
`smoothing.tex` has SHA-256
`85251479BB7D35D73CD5691C194D33B3ADC1BF245BCC248643D969DBBA0E7928`.

The preserved R26 evidence is recorded in:

- [`stacks-errata-a04446e-r26-build-2026-08-28.json`](stacks-errata-a04446e-r26-build-2026-08-28.json)

  `651fff448fa41a4e7c38970eec169328002ac4f6`, 24 PDFs, 2,437 pages,
  25,862,999 bytes, fixed point on sweep four, and zero listed serious
  diagnostics;
- [`stacks-errata-a04446e-r26-visual-qa-2026-08-28.json`](stacks-errata-a04446e-r26-visual-qa-2026-08-28.json)
  — all 37 pages of `smoothing.pdf` reviewed and all 15 correction-locus pages
  inspected at high resolution with zero recorded rendering defects; and
- [`stacks-errata-a04446e-r26-reproducibility-2026-08-28.json`](stacks-errata-a04446e-r26-reproducibility-2026-08-28.json)
  together with the [second full receipt](stacks-errata-a04446e-r26-reproducibility-second-2026-08-28.json)
  — exact equality of all 24 artifact identities across two independent linked
  worktree builds.

The
[`ai-integrated-stacks-r26-publication-2026-08-28.json`](ai-integrated-stacks-r26-publication-2026-08-28.json)
receipt binds the public R26 tag at commit
`7720e2fd3080c39b02275e34c67421ea9cff31d8`, tree
`cc3b7a21d57d07d70db1323487d125a2f69f98c8`, to the exact six-asset
[GitHub release](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-ai-integrated-stacks-project/releases/tag/ai-integrated-stacks-r26-2026-08-28)
and [Zenodo version DOI `10.5281/zenodo.22146844`](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22146844)
under concept DOI `10.5281/zenodo.22135180`. Anonymous readback matched all
172,480,328 bytes on each host by filename, byte count, and SHA-256; all three
downloaded ZIPs passed CRC and member replay. The source projection records six
privacy replacements in four historical provenance files and preserves all
unchanged source payloads byte-for-byte.

R26 adjudication accepted 31 producer identities, aliased
`SMOOTHING-002/003/004` to existing R1 corrections, rejected
`SMOOTHING-010`, and merged the repeated semantic groups `005+031`,
`008+012+013+014`, `016+018`, and `017+019` before materializing 25 new stable
units. At that historical checkpoint, the incomplete EGA I–IV program had
reached EGA I §6.4.13 and resumed at §6.5.1; the current public EGA cursor is
recorded separately below.

## Historical R27 composition, validation, and publication receipts

## Historical R28 composition, validation, and publication receipts

R28 advances the integrated registry to **29 overlays / 861 stable IDs** at
admission commit `655c8e0e1fe9e7b350244a0ef0230fb6c38e0026`, tree
`5eddd7d6db54d25eccf09cf21d5d7ab30c3ec1d3`. Its R1–R28 Stacks errata subset
contains 28 batches, 849 correction IDs, and 962 exact v2 operations. R28 adds
one supersession-aware replacement affecting cumulative `smoothing.tex`.

At the historical R28 checkpoint,
[`composition-current.json`](composition-current.json) bound the R28 registry
cutoff and source composition to the cumulative 962-operation projection; its
live successor now binds R38.
