# Integration roadmap

This roadmap describes the intended order of future corpus integration for the
[Unofficial Stacks Project AI Drafts](README.md). It is a sequence of
bounded, evidence-gated milestones—not a claim that the listed material has
already been integrated. Current admitted coverage is recorded in
[Project status](STATUS.md), while detailed EGA evidence and its exact semantic
cursor live in the [EGA integration dossier](ega/README.md). EGA is only
partially composed into the root source; its complete English discovery and
French diplomatic editions remain separate read-only inputs.

## Stacks-on-Stacks development program

The aim is a readable, reusable mathematical scaffold extending from classical
algebraic geometry toward derived geometry, with a clearly marked unofficial
draft layer. The work below is a program of deliverables, not a claim that it
already exists in the current source. Each substantial source is pinned before
its theorem inventory is processed; covered results are mapped, not rewritten.

| Workstream | Intended deliverable |
| --- | --- |
| Continuous errata | Independently adjudicated, precisely attributed corrections applied to cumulative source, with immediate original/diff comparisons. |
| EGA and foundational SGA | Finish the EGA source-order comparison and integrate worthwhile missing proofs or formulations, interleaving SGA prerequisites where needed. |
| Tôhoku | Close the five source-integration gaps listed below; do not equate the completed historical dossier with complete source integration. |
| Verdier | Audit and integrate the full thesis beyond the already composed Proposition II.1.2.13, distinguishing covered, new, and historically unfinished material. |
| FAC/FGA/GAGA/SGA | Preserve and normalize existing contributions, and complete remaining source scope without duplicating what Stacks already proves. |
| DAG and Kerodon | Build the required higher-categorical and derived-algebraic-geometric bridge through a pinned Kerodon endpoint, with independently written exposition. |
| Illusie and prismatic geometry | Develop the cotangent-complex, deformation and crystalline prerequisites and the subsequent prismatic bridge. |
| Pursuing Stacks | Harvest nonduplicative results and useful categorical architecture from the source edition. |
| Modular theory and NCG | Later develop the operator-algebraic foundations and Tomita–Takesaki exposition, including unbounded conjugate-linear operators, adjoints, closure and polar decomposition. |
| Reader and study program | Deliver searchable rendered mathematics with unmistakably separate official and AI-draft layers, original/diff/provenance views, and multilingual self-study interfaces. |

The order is dependency-led. Modular theory has substantial independent
functional-analytic prerequisites; it is not expected to follow automatically
from DAG or prismatic cohomology. Existing official Stacks web-reader features
should be examined before duplicating them. The new reader's distinctive work
is the integrated draft comparison and learning interface.

A contribution progresses through source review, duplicate checking,
independent mathematical reconstruction, notation normalization, cumulative
composition, deterministic build/reference checks, visual review and public
readback. These remain AI-written mathematical drafts, not proof-assistant
certificates. A recorded unresolved gap does not satisfy a completion gate.
GitHub records incremental validated work; Zenodo preserves substantial coherent
milestones rather than every theorem or routine errata round.

## Tohoku source-integration gap

The historical Tôhoku dossier is not evidence that all of its draft proofs
are present in the current readable source. A direct comparison at public
commit `6c5f549dcdec6051dfeaf0e5300faf3b80576830` found these outstanding
integration candidates:

- Theorem 2.2.2: right satellites under injective-effacement hypotheses and
  their exactness criterion; the dossier's corresponding labels are absent
  from current `homology.tex`.
- Theorem 2.4.1: the proposed composite-functor spectral sequence with
  additive first functor and left-exact second functor; current `derived.tex`
  still assumes both functors left exact.
- Theorem 3.7.3: the Leray spectral sequence for relative families of
  supports; its mapped proof label is absent from current `cohomology.tex`.
- Theorems 5.5.6 and 5.6.3: equivariant Čech comparison and the three
  equivariant Ext spectral sequences; the mapped new-proof labels are absent
  from current `cohomology.tex`.

The next production action for this gap is to locate the exact historical
proof sources bound by the [r71 dossier](tohoku_r71/STATUS.md), independently
check them against the current Stacks text and original hypotheses, and
compose only nonduplicative accepted additions through the normal build and
publication workflow. Do not copy an entire older chapter over this branch
or count dossier closure as source integration. This remains unfinished work;
it does not change the separately recorded EGA source-order cursor.

## Current maintenance baseline

The last verified public main is
`f73b18165c7162b8386de06cc3c50bd4ced745b6`, containing errata R39 and
EGA I §6.6.4. Local R40–R47 composition is committed at
`b3c4a28c053dbbd45670dd19cf0dcc45063190dc`: 177 exact corrections across five
chapters, with independent source replay complete. Fresh cumulative build,
visual and publication gates remain open. EGA I §6.6.5 has locally validated
existing coverage; its next source unit is §6.6.6. See [status](STATUS.md) and
[validation](VALIDATION.md) for the separate local/public states.

### Preserved R33 baseline

The historical R33 composition contains **34 overlays / 1,042 stable IDs** at
the R33 successor `acb48c7edaf9595b542b003ed360399870188b7f`, tree
`8356ae1652ae4ce6a22a457855072c5a3e7b3ad4`. Its Stacks errata component is
R1–R33: 33 batches, 1,030 correction IDs, and 1,166 exact v2 operations. The 22nd
overlay, `stacks-verdier-a04446e-1-2-13-r1`, remains a separately admitted,
independently written historical-source contribution with 12 non-official
stable units. It inserts one manifest-bound lemma into cumulative `derived.tex`;
no official Stacks tag or upstream endorsement is claimed.

R22 and R23 add 93 correction IDs and 106 manifest-bound operations affecting
only `more-algebra.tex`. R24 adds 38 IDs and 57 operations affecting only
`spaces-duality.tex`; R25 adds 131 IDs and 154 operations affecting only
`artin.tex`; R26 adds 25 IDs and 39 operations affecting only `smoothing.tex`;
R27 adds 14 IDs and 14 operations affecting only `modules.tex`. R28 adds one
operation affecting only `smoothing.tex`, explicitly superseding R26 operation
`MC-STK-ERR-1183-OP1`. R29 adds 30 IDs and 31 operations affecting only
`sites-modules.tex`; R30 adds 40 IDs and 40 operations affecting only
`injectives.tex`; R31 adds one operation to `sites-modules.tex`; and R32 adds
125 operations across `fields.tex`, `categories.tex`, and `algebra.tex`. All
are composed in registry order without replacing cumulative source wholesale.
The R33 registry import is
`b2ffa008fc27bfdb8b93c431f4df0c3e197d3440`; source composition is
`9100eefe0819f9632c6129e6d6f19a4101d223d1`, tree
`d786a8604e7c0be79fab77c380247bd971555520`, followed by the validated build
binding at `1c90a67eb42de28884be05abd8fb58f781aed7db`. The exact authority, registry,
operation, source, and preservation identities are recorded in the
[historical R33 release receipt](validation/stacks-errata-a04446e-r33-release-2026-08-30.json).

The historical R33 source passed two linked-worktree fixed-point builds at source
`1c90a67eb42de28884be05abd8fb58f781aed7db`, tree
`3c292f9a4b94162ede69d2633b1272b057a498c3`: 28 readable PDFs, 2,730 pages,
29,277,302 PDF bytes, global fixed point on sweep four, and zero fatal or listed
serious diagnostics. All 116 affected-chapter pages passed review, with all 5
correction-locus pages at 180 DPI. All 28 PDF identities
match exactly between the two builds. Earlier R26, R24, R22/R23, Verdier, and R21 receipts
remain preserved as historical evidence for their exact scopes.

## Registry-order maintenance state

R29 is admitted at `8b70e94d7d9a1f28041445e52df03bffd2980435` and its
append-only transport repair is preserved at the R30 cutoff `256846d6…`.
R30 is directly admitted at that same cutoff. Their cumulative source
composition is `3e57820736a5a57ddb1c9fbaaf2206e455b5ee31`; its 71 exact
operations affect only `sites-modules.tex` and `injectives.tex`. R29's final
manifest SHA-256 is
`52920239C887757CE937267C5505AD98980464329BC6BBBD62086ED4E1D98CE5`;
R30's is `C903DFCA06DA4063782BB88B2F2AC5FCF56352CF948CF03382D77F1A54A48C9E`.
The rejected R26 producer `SMOOTHING-010` and R23 producer
`MORE-ALGEBRA-J-006` remain excluded from the integrated source.

## Recommended order

| Stage | Bounded milestone | Why it comes here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Complete EGA I** | Continue at EGA I §6.6.4 through §§6.6–10 in source order, using staged checkpoints. | This continues from the exact existing cursor, preserves statement order, and finishes the language-of-schemes layer before later corpora depend on it. |
| **2. Integrate EGA II** | Begin with §1 on affine morphisms; continue through §§2–4 on `Proj`, projective bundles, and ample sheaves; then close §§5–8 on quasi-projective, proper, projective, finite, and quasi-finite morphisms, valuative criteria, blowups, and contractions. | EGA II is the shortest path from scheme language to the global morphism machinery used by EGA III and substantial parts of SGA1. |
| **3. Integrate the foundations of SGA1** | Treat Exposés I–V first, then the fibred-category bridge in Exposé VI and the descent layer in Exposés VIII–IX. The revised edition contains no Exposé VII. | This yields a coherent foundation in étale, smooth, and flat morphisms, Galois categories, fibred categories, and descent without prematurely taking on the advanced specialization and cohomological material. |
| **4. Integrate EGA III** | Proceed in source order through coherent cohomology, projective and proper finiteness, formal functions, base change, and existence results. | EGA III can reuse EGA II's projective/proper foundation, the existing FAC, GAGA, and FGA source integrations, and the closed Tôhoku dossier-only mapping. It also supplies leverage for the advanced part of SGA1. |
| **5. Complete advanced SGA1** | Integrate Exposés X–XIII: specialization, examples and complements, algebraic–analytic comparison, and cohomological properness. | These exposés have wider dependency surfaces and become more directly verifiable after EGA III; the existing GAGA integration provides an additional comparison layer for Exposé XII. |
| **6. Integrate EGA IV** | Work fascicle by fascicle, with separately sealed subsection-level milestones. | EGA IV is the broadest and most technically entangled EGA layer. Deferring it avoids turning one very large corpus into a gate for the smaller, higher-leverage milestones above. |

## Immediate milestones

The current semantic cursor is **EGA I §6.6.4**. EGA I §6.6.3 is the latest
source-bound semantic checkpoint, public at GitHub tag
[`ega-i-6.6.3-semantic-2026-08-30`](https://github.com/KokunoYumeto/unofficial-ai-integrated-stacks-project/releases/tag/ega-i-6.6.3-semantic-2026-08-30)
and Zenodo version DOI [`10.5281/zenodo.22177421`](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22177421),
with the exact checkpoint in
[`ega-i-6.6.3-semantic-checkpoint-2026-08-30.json`](validation/ega-i-6.6.3-semantic-checkpoint-2026-08-30.json).
It changes no root TeX or PDF and does not create a new errata round. Earlier
6.4 and 6.5.x receipts remain preserved as historical evidence.
The next checkpoints remain deliberately small enough to review, validate, and
publish independently:

1. **EGA I §6.6.4 and the remainder of §6** — continue in source order and
   close EGA I §6.
2. **EGA I §§7–10** — advance in source order through separately sealed
   section or subsection checkpoints until EGA I is complete.
3. **EGA II §1** — seven subsections on affine morphisms, printed pages 5–18.
   This is the first post–EGA I checkpoint and lies wholly within the currently
   sealed direct-authority range.
4. **EGA II §§2–8** — proceed in bounded source-order tranches, beginning with
   homogeneous spectra and relative `Proj` rather than treating the volume as
   a single release.

## Why EGA II precedes SGA1

EGA II has greater immediate dependency leverage and lower setup risk:

- the repository already has stable EGA source-unit identities, deterministic
  intake, semantic-map validation, residual tracking, and direct-authority
  bindings that extend into EGA II;
- its affine, projective, proper, finite, quasi-finite, and valuative machinery
  is reused by both EGA III and later SGA1 exposés;
- its subject matter directly overlaps the project's completed FAC and FGA
  source integrations and the closed Tôhoku dossier-only mapping, making
  notation reconciliation and gap detection incremental;
- starting SGA1 first would require a new corpus-level authority and mapping
  scaffold while immediately crossing étale, descent, fundamental-group,
  analytic-comparison, and nonabelian cohomological boundaries.

This ordering does not rank EGA II as mathematically more important than
SGA1. It places the reusable dependency layer first so that SGA1 can be
integrated in smaller, more testable exposé groups.

## Evidence gate for every milestone

A milestone is complete only when all applicable gates pass:

1. Every promoted claim is bound to an exact primary-source locus and a pinned
   Stacks source identity.
2. Every source statement has an explicit disposition: existing coverage,
   stronger or split coverage, residual, source issue, or justified local
   integration.
3. Lexical similarity alone never establishes mathematical equivalence, and
   local labels are never presented as official Stacks tags.
4. Any source addition is proved, normalized to surrounding Stacks notation,
   checked for duplicate or superseding coverage, and validated with its
   affected chapters.
5. Deterministic mapping, structural, reference, and build checks pass before
   the milestone is described as admitted coverage.
